# Shopping Cart 2
Instead of creating a static shopping list with paper and a pen, create it dynamically. Take the list item and the price from the user and further find the grand total.

 Details:

 <ol>

 <li>Two input fields should be displayed that take name and price as input.</li>
 <br>
 <li>A button with innerText <code>Add</code> should be rendered.</li>
 <br>
 <li>When the add button is clicked, list should be updated and rendered through a table.</li>
 <br>
 <li> **data-ns-test="item-name"** and **data-ns-test="item-price"** should be used to label name and price in table</li>
 <br>
 <li> <code>item-name-input</code> and <code>item-price-input</code> should be used as id for name and price input fields. </li>
 <br>
 <li>Total price of all element in the list should be displayed in an element with <code>data-ns-test="grandTotal"</code>. This element should only have the value of the total and no other string.</li>
 <br>
 <li>Input fields should be cleared once element has been added to the list</li>
 <br>
 <li>Initially, table should have only one row with grandTotal as 0.</li>
 <br>
 <li>Invalid input should not be accepted.</li>
 
 </ol>
